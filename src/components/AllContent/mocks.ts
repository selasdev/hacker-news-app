            "I love The Dig. When my father bought it to me, he said it was supposed to be a movie, but it was cancelled, so they turned it into a game. Don't know if that's true, but this is a great game. I don't have that kind time to finish it again now a days, but I did watched a YouTube video of someone playing it to the end. Again, great game.<p>Fun fact: this was one of the first games I ever played that had Portuguese subtitles.",
